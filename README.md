# Slay the Graph

This is a concept project for generating randomized directed graphs for use
in a [Slay-the-Spire](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Slay_the_Spire_Wiki)
inspired game.

This concept project just generates the directed graph that the player
character will traverse; it does not generate the actual content of the nodes
(e.g., chests, monsters).


## Requirements

* Python 3.10


## Usage

To run the concept project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m slay_the_graph
```
